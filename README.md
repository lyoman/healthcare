TOWARDS ACHIEVING AN INTELLIGENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

(Case for SALLY MUGABE CENTRAL HOSPITAL)
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The project is a proposed real time monitoring system for admitted patients in the Sally Mugabe Central Hospital. The system comprises of wearable sensors attached to a sensor belt which is worn by the patient. The belt extracts medical vitals from the patients and provides this vital information which includes blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiration rate, body acceleration and blood oxygen level. The system will have an interface for the doctors and nurses, where all the patient’s vital information in real time is displayed. In case of any anomaly in a patient’s health , or abrupt change in a patient’s vitals, the system raises an alarm for the doctors and nurses to attend to the specific patient immediately.
The information database for the system is held physically at the hospital, as well as a virtually accessible database. The information, via a webserver is stored on a cloud, and extended access is given to specialists and referring physicians despite geographical location of the specialist from the patient. The system advocates for telemedicine, and is a  huge stride towards delivering HEALTH 4.0 for the Zimbabwean ehealthcare sector.
